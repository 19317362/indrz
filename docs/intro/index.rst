Welcome to indrz 
================

Background
==========

Indrz was developed out of the need to quickly communicate
how to get from point A to point B in a complex set of buildings.
Being late for your first class is never a good thing, so
to help the students out indrz was born.



Design Decisions
================

Indrz is built for pure simplicity and quick information exchange.
A user visiting a site should quickly see their destination and
orient themselves.  Indrz is not designed as a virtual reality app
guiding you every step of the way but more like a quick reference.
You still will need to look around, but getting lost and walking
into pillars while staring at your phone should no longer happen.

Research Areas
==============

We are looking to expand our horizons

 * Auto generating indoor route descriptions based on points of interest and landmarks is an area in need of more research.
 * Semi-Automatic data conversion from DWG, DXF, PDF, JPG to PostGIS vector polygons, lines, and points.
 * Generation of polygon centerlines, skeletons
 * Complex topology rule checking

Goals - Vision
==============

We want to make sure every one can find there way with ease and make them aware of how wayfinding works teaching you at the same time how to find your way in any and every indoor environment.
